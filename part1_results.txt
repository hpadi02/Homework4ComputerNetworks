Part 1: External Downloads
---------------------------
Testscript1.txt:
- Sequential time: 21.97 seconds
- Concurrent time (10 connections): 2.55 seconds
- Speedup: 2.9x

Testscript2.txt:
- Sequential time: 16.13 seconds
- Concurrent time (10 connections): 9.61 seconds
- Speedup: 1.68x

Analysis:
The concurrent downloads showed a speedup of 2.9 for testscript1 and 1.68
for testscript2. This speedup is achieved because:

1. Network Latency: While one connection is waiting for server response,
   other connections can continue downloading, reducing overall wait time.

2. Concurrent Request Processing: Multiple HTTP requests are sent simultaneously,
   allowing the client to utilize available bandwidth more efficiently.

3. Server Response Time: If the server takes time to process each request,
   concurrent connections allow multiple requests to be processed in parallel.

The speedup may vary based on:
- Network conditions and latency
- Server response times
- File sizes in the test scripts
- Available bandwidth
- Number of concurrent connections (10 in this test)

Factors that could limit speedup:
- Bandwidth saturation: Too many connections can saturate available bandwidth
- Server rate limiting: Some servers limit connections per client
- Connection overhead: Each connection has setup/teardown costs
- Small file sizes: For very small files, connection overhead dominates
